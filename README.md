## Hey there!

I only use this account for collaborations on projects hosted on GitHub.

Sure, it is. But come on. Seriously? Hosting free/open source software on a commercial, closed-source platform run by Microsoft? I can not comprehend how this is an actual thing.

Have you heard of [embrace, extend, extinguish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish)? Or [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification)? Even today, Microsoft appropriates all code hosted on GitHub and sells it back to us through GitHub Copilot.

GitHub was an interesting experiment but let's move back to community-owned, decentralized, free and open source platforms.
